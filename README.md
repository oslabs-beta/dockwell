## About
https://dockwell.tech/
---
Dockwell is an intuitive and comprehensive GUI that tracks, monitors, and displays all of a user's Docker containers.

We made Dockwell so that developers can quickly visualize container metrics to assist in their debugging and development process.

With the needs of developers in mind, Dockwell uses Prometheus and cAdvisor to scrape real-time metrics from the host machine, all from its own containerized environment.

Dockwell is an open source project and we would love to hear your feedback!
